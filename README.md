# Insertion-Sort-Project
## A project for Algorithm task from Patika.dev course
### 1) [22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort
Task 1' Write the stages of the array:

[22,27,16,2,18,6]
[16,22,27,2,18,6]
[2,16,22,27,18,6]
[2,16,18,22,27,6]
[2,6,16,18,22,27]

### 2) Task 2' What is the Big-O of this array.
O(n^2) for the worst case. 
O(n) for the average or best case.

### 3) Time Complexity
Average case: The element we are looking for is in the MIDDLE.
Worst case: The element we are looking for is in the END.
Best case: The element we are looking for is in the START.
### 4) After the sorting array, what is case of 18?

The case of 18 is the average case since its in the middle.

### 5) [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] first 4 step as Insertion Sort

[3,7,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[3,5,7,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[2,3,5,7,8,9,4,15,6]

[2,3,4,5,7,8,9,15,6]
